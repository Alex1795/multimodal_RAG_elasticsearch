  "generated_description": "Visitors walk along a wooden boardwalk photographing active geothermal features while thick steam rises around them. The elevated walkway allows safe viewing of hot springs and geysers while protecting the fragile thermal environment. Dense clouds of steam partially obscure the tourists as they capture the natural spectacle."

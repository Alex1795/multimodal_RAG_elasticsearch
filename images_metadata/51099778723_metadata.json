  "description": "The trail goes from the trailhead steeply on serpentines into the depth until the Tonto Plateau is reached at the \"Indian Garden\".  \n\tThe Bright Angel Trail is the best developed trail down into the canyon and is traveled not only by hikers, but also by mule caravans carrying riding guests or supplying stations in the canyon. Hikers are required to make way for the mules.\n\t           ",

  "generated_description": "The famous Bright Angel Trail's serpentine switchbacks descend steeply into the Grand Canyon from the rim. This well-developed trail system navigates the challenging terrain with carefully engineered curves to manage the elevation change. The trail serves both hikers and mule caravans that transport supplies and visitors into the canyon depths."
